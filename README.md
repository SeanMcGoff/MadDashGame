# Mad Dash for Short-Term Cash: On the Present Threat of our Anarchic World

A game by Sean McGoff and Finn Foote

## What is this Game?

This game came from a combination of a love for Mario Party, a desire to learn the Godot engine, and the need to make something that represents 
international relations for a school project.

## How do you play?
In this fast-paced game, students will very quickly realize the importance of the theories of international relations, as their survival depends on it. 
A party-game at heart, games will only last 5-7 minutes at most. 
Every player will start with a clock set at 2 minutes (although this might be a setting that one can change in the future). 
When the game starts, the clock immediately starts ticking down. 
Players will race to the gold mining machine to start collecting gold. 
To mine gold, players will need to be in the gray dotted area, and click on the terminal when the light flashes green. 
This green flash is directly tied to every tick of their clock. 

The players then can use their gold to do 1 of 4 things:
1. Slow down the rate of their clock (done by running to your clock and left-clicking)
2. Slow down the rate of another player’s clock (done by running to another players clock and left-clicking)
3. Speed up the rate of another player’s clock (done by running to another players clock and right-clicking)
4. Give gold directly to another player (done by clicking on another player)

Note that since your possible gold output is directly tied to your clocks’ speed, a player with a faster ticking clock will produce more gold, and vice-versa. 
The end of the game is reached when only one player’s clock has not reached 0:00.

## Installation

Installation is rather simple. Find and download the newest version on the [releases page](https://github.com/SeanMcGoff/MadDashGame/releases), and double click on the binary file that works with your OS. The code is not signed, so Windows SmartScreen and MacOS's security will flag the file as being from an unidentified developer. To get around this, follow these guides:
